I'm a certified cyborg. I enjoy weird food, hiking, milkshakes and games with a good story. I want to make the world a better place.

I'm a PHD researcher and Teaching Assistant at Ghent University - IDLab - imec.

* My research specializes in DataOps and cloud modelling languages.
* I assist in teaching distributed data processing, DataOps, DevOps, systems programming, C/C++ and Python.

I'm a passionate user of and contributor to open source. Some of the stuff I've worked on:

* I'm maintaining a bunch of Snap packages including [Krita](https://snapcraft.io/krita), [Arduino IDE](https://snapcraft.io/arduino), [Foliate](https://snapcraft.io/foliate), [PhotoScape](https://snapcraft.io/photoscape) and [Easy OpenVPN Server](https://snapcraft.io/easy-openvpn-server).
* I contribute to the [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io) ecosystem by writing [documentation](https://forum.snapcraft.io/search?expanded=true&q=%23doc%20%40galgalesh), blog posts, and PR's for [`snapcraft`](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Agalgalesh+) and [`snapd`](https://github.com/snapcore/snapd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Agalgalesh+).
* I helped kickstart the Ubuntu community theme initiative, though my biggest contribution there might have been [suggesting to call it "Yaru"](https://web.archive.org/web/20191221231025/https://didrocks.fr/2018/04/24/welcome-to-the-ubuntu-bionic-age-behind-communitheme-interviewing-merlijn/).
* I used to be very active in the Juju community, writing a bunch of Big Data Charms as part of the [Tengu Team](https://jaas.ai/u/tengu-team), writing a bunch of documentation, and helping design the 2.0 version of the [`charms.reactive`](https://charmsreactive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework and writing a paper about [how cool it is](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325618935_Beyond_Generic_Lifecycles_Reusable_Modeling_of_Custom-Fit_Management_Workflows_for_Cloud_Applications). Had the great pleasure of being [appreciated by Jorge Castro](http://www.jorgecastro.org/2015/11/20/i-appreciate-merlijn-sebrechts/) and can confirm [he is a Chinese botnet](https://meta.askubuntu.com/a/1902/172367).
* I answered [a bunch of questions](https://askubuntu.com/users/172367/merlijn-sebrechts) on AskUbuntu.

I've been a board member of [Hackerspace.Gent](https://hackerspace.gent) since 2014 and wrote the [Hackerspace Blueprint](https://hackerspace.design); a booklet about how to run a leaderless organization using do-ocracy.
