PhD holder and certified cyborg. I enjoy special foods, hiking, and games with a good story. I want to make the world a better place.

I'm a senior researcher at imec and teaching fellow at Ghent University in the IDLab research group in Belgium.

## Research

I lead a number of research tracks focused on software deployment and trust in the cloud and on devices.

* Making it easier to deploy and manage complex applications, both in the cloud and on IoT devices
* Ensuring operators can verify and trust the software running on a device or in the cloud
* Improving the security of processing sensitive data with confidential algorithms

I manage international research projects in collaboration with industry and academia, advise PhD students, coach researchers, and develop research proposals.

Open source is a common thread in my work, both as an enabler for trust and as a way to increase the impact of my research. I'm involved both at the governance level, for example as part of the Ubuntu Community Council, and at a technical level, for example, building WebAssembly System Interfaces with the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and the Bytecode Alliance.

Interests: WebAssembly, Confidential Computing, Kubernetes, Virtualization, Open Source, the intersection between law and IT

## Lectures & keynotes

I teach at Ghent University and frequently speak for industry professionals and the general public on topics such as

* Infrastructure as Code
* Open Source software and AI
* Distributed Systems Design
* OS and network security

I'm always happy to share my knowledge and help solve problems, so let me know if you need an expert!

## Open Source & Community

* I'm [part of the Ubuntu Community council](https://merlijn.sebrechts.be/blog/2024-02-17-ubuntu-community-council-year/) since 2022.
* I'm maintaining a bunch of Snap packages including [Signal Desktop](https://snapcraft.io/signal-desktop), [Arduino IDE](https://snapcraft.io/arduino), [PhotoScape](https://snapcraft.io/photoscape) and [Easy OpenVPN Server](https://snapcraft.io/easy-openvpn-server).
* I contribute to the [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io) ecosystem by writing [documentation](https://forum.snapcraft.io/search?expanded=true&q=%23doc%20%40galgalesh), blog posts, and PR's for [`snapcraft`](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amerlijn-sebrechts+) and [`snapd`](https://github.com/snapcore/snapd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amerlijn-sebrechts+).
* I helped kickstart the Ubuntu community theme initiative, although my biggest contribution there might have been [suggesting to call it "Yaru"](https://web.archive.org/web/20191221231025/https://didrocks.fr/2018/04/24/welcome-to-the-ubuntu-bionic-age-behind-communitheme-interviewing-merlijn/).
* I used to be very active in the Juju community, writing a bunch of Big Data Charms as part of the [Tengu Team](https://jaas.ai/u/tengu-team), writing a bunch of documentation, and helping design the 2.0 version of the [`charms.reactive`](https://charmsreactive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework and writing a paper about [how cool it is](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325618935_Beyond_Generic_Lifecycles_Reusable_Modeling_of_Custom-Fit_Management_Workflows_for_Cloud_Applications). Had the great pleasure of being [appreciated by Jorge Castro](http://www.jorgecastro.org/2015/11/20/i-appreciate-merlijn-sebrechts/) and can confirm [he is a Chinese botnet](https://meta.askubuntu.com/a/1902/172367).
* I answered [a bunch of questions](https://askubuntu.com/users/172367/merlijn-sebrechts) on AskUbuntu.
* I wrote the [Hackerspace Blueprint](https://hackerspace.design); a booklet about how to run a leaderless organization using do-ocracy.
