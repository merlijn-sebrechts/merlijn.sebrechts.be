Meta just introduced its state of the art Llama 3.1 AI model and accompanied the launch with a blogpost explaining "Open Source AI is the path forward". But buyer beware: Llama 3.1 itself is a legal labyrinth.

Despite what Meta is implying, Llama 3.1 is not an open source AI. The AI model itself is licensed under [the Llama 3.1 license](https://llama.meta.com/llama3_1/license/) and the [Llama 3.1 acceptable use policy](https://llama.meta.com/llama3_1/use-policy/). The main problem with this license is that **it heavily restricts who can use the model and for what purpose**. Make sure you understand the license before you integrate Llama 3.1 into your product!

> Note that I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice. At most, I'm asking to contact your own lawyer before using Llama in your own products.

There are four main problems with this license,

## It prohibits legitimate behavior

Llama 3.1's acceptable use policy explains what you and your users are not allowed to do with the model. Apart from prohibiting dangerous behavior, it also prohibits a lot of legitimate behavior as part of overly-broad clauses such as the following:

> [1.]g. [..] or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with or impair the proper working, integrity, operation or appearance of a website or computer system

So you can't use Llama to "change the proper appearence of a website". Does this mean you can't use Llama to translate a website to your native tongue? Blind people are not allowed to use Llama to dictate the UI of an app?

And what does "interfere" mean exactly? Is an AI adblocker "interfering" with a website?

The first part of that article is also problematic for my day job teaching cyber security.

> [1.]g. Create, generate, or facilitate the creation of malicious code, malware, computer viruses [..]

I'll tell you a secret: I've used AI to help me write lab exercises where we teach students how to break computer security. This is a great way to teach students how to make software more secure. Why should I not be allowed to use AI for that?

Moreover, if you create an app using Llama 3.1, this policy also applies to your users. **Do you have the required safeguards in place to ensure users cannot do these things?**

## It's an agreement not to sue

The Llama 3.1 license contains a very broad agreement not to sue Meta for IP infringement. Take a look at article 5.c:

> [5.]c. If you institute litigation or other proceedings against Meta **or any entity** (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Llama Materials or Llama 3.1 outputs or results, or any portion of any of the foregoing, **constitutes infringement of intellectual property or other rights owned or licensable by you**, then **any licenses granted to you under this Agreement shall terminate** as of the date such litigation or claim is filed or instituted.

It's widely known that AI can generate copyrighted content. OpenAI themselves even clearly state users are responsible for ensuring the content generated by OpenAI is not copyright protected. AI models are not "copyright washing machines": they don't magically remove copyright from protected content.

However, due to this license, Llama users are protected from copyright lawsuits, because the moment you try to sue them, you lose access to Llama yourself. So you are given a choice: either benefit from this "Open Source AI" and lose the ability to enforce your intellectual property, or become an AI luddite.

## It enforces Meta's moral code

## It adds a legal uncertainty

## It excludes almost arbitrary people from using it

> 2. Additional Commercial Terms. If, on the Llama 3.1 version release date, the monthly active users of the products or services made available by or for Licensee, or Licensee’s affiliates, is greater than 700 million monthly active users in the preceding calendar month, you must request a license from Meta, which Meta may grant to you in its sole discretion, and you are not authorized to exercise any of the rights under this Agreement unless or until Meta otherwise expressly grants you such rights.
